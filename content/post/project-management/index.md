## PhD position
I have accepted a Full PhD Scholarship offer from the School of Cosmic Physics, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, Ireland starting September 1, 2024.
I will be working with Dr. Emma Chambers within the Geophysics Sectioon of DIAS on the MOD3LTHERM Project. I am excited about the PhD position and the potential impact of the project on assessing clean renewable energy resources such as Geothermal energy in Ireland and other parts of the World.
