## PhD position
I have accepted a Full PhD Scholarship offer from the [School of Cosmic Physics](https://www.dias.ie/cosmicphysics/), [Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies](https://www.dias.ie/), Ireland starting September 1, 2024.
I will be working with [Dr. Emma Chambers](https://www.dias.ie/cosmicphysics/geophysics/geo-staff/geo-dr-emma-chambers/) within the [Geophysics Section of DIAS](https://www.dias.ie/cosmicphysics/geophysics/geo-aboutus/) on the [MOD3LTHERM Project](https://mod3ltherm.ie/). I am excited about the PhD position and the potential impact of the project in the assessment of clean renewable energy resources such as Geothermal energy in Ireland and other parts of the World.
